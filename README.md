# table structure

CREATE TABLE task (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);



## How to Deploy the Backend

Follow these steps to deploy the backend:

1. **Set up the environment**:
    - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your server.
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend project and configure the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection, API keys).

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the project** (if applicable):
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Run database migrations** (if your project uses migrations):
    ```sh
    npm run migrate
    ```

5. **Start the server**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

6. **Set up a process manager** (e.g., PM2) to keep the server running:
    ```sh
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start server.js --name "backend-server"
    pm2 save
    pm2 startup
    ```

7. **Configure a reverse proxy** (e.g., Nginx) to route traffic to your backend server.

8. **Test the deployment**:
    - Verify the backend is running by accessing the API endpoints.



    ## How to Run with Docker

    You can use Docker to containerize and run the application. Follow these steps:

    1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:
        Ensure you have a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project. It should define the services for the frontend, backend, and database.

        Example structure:
        ```yaml
        version: '3.8'
        services:
          frontend:
            build:
              context: ./frontend
            ports:
              - "3000:3000"
            depends_on:
              - backend

          backend:
            build:
              context: ./backend
            ports:
              - "5000:5000"
            environment:
              - DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@db:3306/tasks
            depends_on:
              - db

          db:
            image: mysql:8
            environment:
              MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
              MYSQL_DATABASE: tasks
              MYSQL_USER: user
              MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
            ports:
              - "3306:3306"
        ```

    2. **Build and start the containers**:
        Run the following command to build and start all services:
        ```sh
        docker-compose up --build
        ```

    3. **Access the application**:
        - Frontend: Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
        - Backend: API endpoints should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

    4. **Stop the containers**:
        To stop the running containers, use:
        ```sh
        docker-compose down
        ```

    5. **Optional**: Use volumes to persist data for the database container.
    ## üß™ Testing the Application

    ### Frontend Testing

    1. **Install testing dependencies**:
      Ensure you have the necessary testing libraries installed, such as `jest`, `react-testing-library`, or `cypress`:
      ```sh
      npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
      ```

    2. **Run unit tests**:
      Execute the following command to run the unit tests:
      ```sh
      npm test
      ```

    3. **Run end-to-end tests** (if applicable):
      If you are using a tool like Cypress for E2E testing, run:
      ```sh
      npx cypress open
      ```

    4. **Write additional tests**:
      Add test cases for components, hooks, and utility functions in the `__tests__` directory.

    ---

    ### Backend Testing

    1. **Install testing dependencies**:
      Use a testing framework like `jest` or `mocha` along with a library like `supertest` for API testing:
      ```sh
      npm install --save-dev jest supertest
      ```

    2. **Write test cases**:
      Create test files in the `tests` directory to cover API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic.

    3. **Run tests**:
      Execute the following command to run the backend tests:
      ```sh
      npm test
      ```

    4. **Mock external dependencies**:
      Use libraries like `sinon` or `nock` to mock external services and isolate your tests.

    5. **Generate test coverage report**:
      Run the tests with coverage enabled:
      ```sh
      npm test -- --coverage
      ```

    6. **Automate testing**:
      Integrate the tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure they run on every commit or pull request.
